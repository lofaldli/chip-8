# - Locate SDL_gfx library
# This module defines
#  SDLGFX_LIBRARY, the library to link against
#  SDLGFX_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
#  SDLGFX_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL/SDL_gfxPrimitives.h
#
# $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR
# used in building SDL.
#
# Created by Olivier DOLE. This was copied from the FindSDL_image.cmake 
# module.

# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of 
# SDLGFX_LIBRARY to override this selection.
